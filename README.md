# FAKE NEWS PREDICTION

Social media has also been used to spread fake news, which has strong negative impacts on individual users and broader society. The goal of this project is to comprehensively review, summarize, compare and evaluate the current research on fake news. 
This project investigates the principles, methodologies and algorithms for detecting fake news articles from online social networks and evaluating the corresponding performance. Our project builds a deep diffusive network model to learn the representations of news articles and subjects based on a set of explicit and latent features extracted from the textual information. To achieve this, we utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP)methods and online learning algorithms: PAC and LSTM


This project concludes that using passive aggressive and TF-IDF vectorizer is efficient as we obtained 98% of accuracy from this model.
